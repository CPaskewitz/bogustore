# Mock E-commerce Store

## Project Overview

This project is a mock e-commerce store built to showcase the implementation of unit tests. It serves as a demonstration of best practices in React and Next.js development with a particular emphasis on ensuring that the functionality of the store is robust, maintainable, and thoroughly tested.

## Key Features

- **Product Listing:** Displays a variety of products, categorized for easy navigation.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add, remove, and update product quantities in their cart.
- **Checkout Process:** A streamlined two-step process for shipping information and payment details, concluding with an order success page.
- **Pagination:** Seamless navigation through product lists with paginated views.
- **Discounts & Sales:** Products may display sales and discounted prices, offering dynamic price adjustments.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React & Next.js:** For building the user interface and server-side rendering.
- **Redux:** To manage the state of the shopping cart, checkout details, and other application data.
- **TypeScript:** For type-safe code and improved development experience.
- **Jest & React Testing Library:** For writing and running unit tests to validate the functionality of the store.

## Project Purpose

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of unit tests in a real-world application. It aims to provide examples of how to write meaningful tests for various components, pages, and features in a Next.js e-commerce store, including:

- **Component Testing:** Verifying individual UI components like product cards, pagination controls, and forms.
- **Page Testing:** Ensuring entire pages render correctly, including dynamic content based on state and props.
- **Redux Store Testing:** Validating that actions, reducers, and state changes work as expected.
- **API Error Handling:** Testing how the application responds to different API scenarios, including successful data fetching and error handling.
